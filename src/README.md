All the core functions associated with the algorithms are stored here - the user is expected to modify the `noisy_input.py` file to generate/import the signal that needs to be predicted along with the true signal (for generating error metrics). 

To know more about this repository, the kernel or the projection method in detail, or various use cases of the kernel-projection method, including extensions to non-linear systems, please refer to the `resources`folder.
