**For the Authors**

This folder will have a collection of csv or a simple excel file that contains all the tunable parameters (for each of the different methods we have) that the user can modify and run to test out different values. This provides a more visual and user friendly way of tuning the values of the different parameters involved. 

*Excel sheet with tabs, one for each of the estimation methods this library supports. Needs to be UnitTested before its run!*
