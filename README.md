# PETs
***Python Estimation Toolkits (PETs)*** is an agile and capable estimation library that was developed by Manoj Krishna Venkatesan and Nithilasaravanan Kuppan as part of their Master's thesis at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. **PETs** stands as a testament to the years of intense research conducted by Dr. Michalska and her graduate students - the authors have tried their best to include the essential parts of all this research as a single, *easy-to-use* package.

### What is PETs?

***PETs*** is a Python-based state and parameter estimation library consisting of 4 different methods to perform estimation of SISO LTI systems. 


**For the Authors**

New program build in test
- Checked access to config files
- checked access to noisy input
- checked access to src files

TO DO
- check access to gen inputs
- change code in gen input to compare the true derivatives as well (maybe in thesis as well)
- make sure the whole kalman works as a whole
- integrate with the main run_estimation.py script
