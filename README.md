PETS is a collection of the most commonly used parameter and state estimation tools including a new and revolutionary kernel based estimation process developed by Dr. Michalska and her research students at McGill University, Canada.

**For the Authors**

New program build in test
- Checked access to config files
- checked access to noisy input
- checked access to src files

TO DO
- check access to gen inputs
- change code in gen input to compare the true derivatives as well (maybe in thesis as well)
- make sure the whole kalman works as a whole
- integrate with the main run_estimation.py script
